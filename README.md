# Conquering Responsive Layouts

The following are my key takeaways from [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)'s 21-day challenge of learning to create responsive layouts.

## Day 1 - Using percentage % avoiding heights
#### `em` and `rem`

1.  ##### Percentage vs. Fixed Widths
- use `%` instead of `px`
- a website is naturally responsive

2.  ##### Percentages on the child
- Child is always dependent w/ parent interms of size.
3.  ##### Avoid using `height` property
- instead use `padding` if you want more background.

## Day 2 - Getting Familiar w/ relative units

1. ##### `em`
- in relation w/ element's parent

2. ##### `rem`
- it stands for root-`em`.
- it will look to html font size.

**Note:** if you set padding, margin, or boder with `em`, it looks to the `font-size` property of the parent element.
